            <ul>
              <li><strong class="colored-bold">STEM:  Fundamentals of Computer Science III: Data Structures</strong> <br>I really enjoyed this course, which I took during Winter Quarter 2020, just before the pandemic (January - February). It was fast-paced, and the class developed a strong sense of teamwork. The projects were especially fun; we got to create classes and build games like a matchmaking game using C++.
              </li>
              <li><strong class="colored-bold">Non-STEM: Indoor Beginners Cycling</strong> <br>This was my first time taking an exercise course, and I loved it! I got to know everyone in the class, and it made me realize how essential physical activity is for overall well-being.

          <div class="faq-question">Favorite Class at UCSD?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <ul>
              <li><strong class="colored-bold">STEM: DSC102 Systems for Scalable Analytics</strong> <br>This class was super fun. We worked with the cloud and AWS. I loved that we were implementing real-world applications. Though much of it was following step-by-step guides, I didn't mind. I love routine, and this class was a lot of that, but also a lot of understanding how computer systems work together.</li>
              <li><strong class="colored-bold">Non-STEM: Portuguese</strong> <br>I took this course during my last three quarters and absolutely loved learning the language and the culture of Brazil. I found a sense of family within the class and made lifelong friends. Not only did I learn a language, but I'm now capable of communicating when I travel to Brazil.</li>

          <div class="faq-question">Favorite Food?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This might be a little controversial, but I love a good sandwich. When the bread is fresh and toasty, I love mayo and cold cuts. Sandwiches go best with fries in my opinion. You can make a sandwich in so many different ways that it will always be my favorite.

          <div class="faq-question">Who Do You Look Up To?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            I have a few people in mind who have greatly influenced my life. First and foremost is my mom; she has always been a hero to me. While raising both my sister and me, she pursued her college degree, overcoming numerous challenges along the way. Nothing has ever stopped her.
            Another person I look up to is Jessica Hoffman, whom I met during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in Summer 2017. She was my instructor, along with two amazing teaching assistants, Diana Lee Guzman and Anah Lewis. These three women are the reason I have my degree and why I'm in STEM. They taught me not only about computer science but also the importance of sisterhood—something I can never thank them enough for. Since meeting them seven years ago, I've faced many struggles in earning my degree, but their example has always motivated me to keep going. </div>

            <div class="faq-answer"> I have been working for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program for the last four summers. It can also be a little tough to get the students to get engaged being that 
              it is in a vertual enivornment. So our task is to get the students as engaged as they can and not only learn to code but have fun while doing it.

Staying updated is important to me because I want to be aware of what's happening in the world.
