            <div class="faq-answer">I started this year taking a HIIT (High Intensitiy Interval Training) class and I totally fell in love. My mom had done one similar a couple years back so we now are going together most mornings. I love to spend time with my cat Rusty, he's an orange and white cat who is eight years old and big ol' guy. I love to take film pictures
                on my Poloroid, my Kodak Ekon and my Pentax K1000. I love to skateboard even though I get scared to do trick incase I fall, but I do love to ride.

          <div class="faq-question">Favorite Class at PCC?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            STEM: CS08: Algorithms and whatever—I really enjoyed it because I took it during Winter Quarter 2020, right before the pandemic hit (January - February). It was fast-paced, and the class really grew as a team together. The projects were also fun; we were able to create classes and games like a matchmaking game using C++.
            Non-STEM: Indoor Beginners Cycling—I had never taken an exercise course before, and this was my first quarter. I loved it! You got to know everyone in the class, and I realized how important being active is for the body.

          <div class="faq-question">Favorite Class at UCSD?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            STEM: DSC102 Systems for Scalable Analytics—This class was super fun. We worked with the cloud and AWS. I loved that we were implementing real-world applications. Though much of it was following step-by-step guides, I didn’t mind. I love routine, and this class was a lot of that, but also a lot of understanding how computer systems work together.
            Non-STEM: Portuguese—I took this course during my last three quarters and absolutely loved learning the language and the culture of Brazil. I found a sense of family within the class and made lifelong friends. Not only did I learn a language, but I'm now capable of communicating when I travel to Brazil.

          <div class="faq-question">Favorite Food?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This might be a little controversial, but I love a good sandwich. When the bread is fresh and toasty, I love mayo and cold cuts. Sandwiches go best with fries in my opinion. You can make a sandwich in so many different ways that it will always be my favorite.

          <div class="faq-question">Who do you look up to?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <!-- I have a few people in mind. Number one would be my mom; she has always been a hero of mine. She went to college while raising me and got her degree while raising both me and my sister. Though it wasn’t easy, nothing has ever stopped her.
            Another person I look up to is Jessica Hoffman, whom I met during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (Summer 2017). She was my instructor, alongside two amazing teaching assistants, Diana Lee Guzman and Anah Lewis. These three women are the reason I have my degree and why I’m in STEM. They taught me about computer science and the importance of sisterhood, something I can never thank them enough for. Since meeting them 7 years ago, I’ve struggled a lot earning my degree, but knowing that they did it kept me going.
